Gokopy is a lightweight backup files software that runs as a service level or on-demand request.

You can backup the entire directory, folder or even a single file recursively
without worrying about the very long filename or even the deepest and lengthy directories.
	
Gokopy is a CLI tool that can help you ease out the burdens of your daily routine file backups for 
your most valuable files and be able to automate your backup schedules with ease.

In the case of a protected directory, Gokopy can't access it unless you map it with your network set of usernames
and passwords. Gokopy will not keep any of your network credentials at all.
